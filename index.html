                            for a
                            master's degree! I'm a Canadian internet individual who is passionate
                            about a variety of things ranging from gaming to multimedia to mental health to ethics and

                        As of right now, my priority communication method is Discord. My Discord username doesn't have a
                        variant of the Unknown68D name, so feel free to send a DM! DMs should be open most of the time,
                        but there may be instances where they're disabled due to some privacy setting conflict. In that
                        case, refer your additional options below!

                        If you'd like to chat with me in a community-based environment, you'll find me most often in a
                        server called "The Skybox", owned by storyboard artist & fandom enthusiast, <a
                            href="https://linktr.ee/lynxgriffin">LynxGriffin</a>! The welcoming, relaxed,
                        calm, respectful, and above all the compassionate and non-judgmental environment the server
                        provides is unparalleled compared to any server I've been in years prior. If you're interested
                        in reaching me and/or are interested in an awesome Deltarune community, check it out!

                        not, a quick mention in a post is welcomed too! That said, I reserve the full right to ignore
                        any messages I'm not comfortable responding to. All I ask is for basic decency & respect in
                        messages when contacting me.

                        <p>
                            "2022: A Year of Revelations", is a cumulative video project created by me, Unknown68D. In
                            early 2022, I discovered that for the majority of my life, I've suffered from a mental
                            illness
                            known as OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). It's a debilitating condition in which
                            sufferers
                            are bombarded with obsessions, the contents of intrusive, unwanted thoughts. These
                            obsessions
                            are followed by compulsions, (rituals, whether mental or physical) which attempt to relieve
                            the
                            negative emotions and sensations that arise from the obsessions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I spent the rest of the year in therapy, where I finally began truly understand myself and
                            how
                            my mind works. As I learned more about the condition and listened to stories from my fellow
                            OCD
                            sufferers, the spark that is the idea for this video began to ignite. From there, I sought
                            to
                            share my story with the world to help them, the internet generation and all individuals with
                            their
                            mental health.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Clocking in at a little over 7 hours, I present a culmination of all my thoughts, grievances
                            and
                            opinions on the current state of the world as of 2022, along with how the internet has
                            influenced it and what we can do to navigate our current society among other things both
                            previously mentioned and more!

                            "OCD's Taboo Territory" is a spiritual successor to "2022: A Year of Revelations", my first
                            ever video essay where I discussed my OCD diagnosis for the first time. This video's central
                            focus is on the taboo side of this debilitating disorder, arguing that it is one of the most
                            stigmatized and misunderstood mental illnesses in modern-day society, whose obstacles extend
                            beyond mere ignorance and into active pushback territory, meaning there's a deliberate
                            effort and incentivization towards not understanding it, thus further stigmatizing it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm here to help make a breakthrough in the mental health landscape, with one of my personal
                            long-term goals being to bridge the gap between OCD-awareness and the internet generation;
                            to have more informative, compassionate conversations surrounding sensitive topics, as well
                            as dismantling stigma wherever possible. Additionally, I discuss topics of purity culture
                            and sex-positivity through an intersectional approach, as both of these topics contains
                            attitudes, paradigms and frameworks which are useful to dissect to gain key insights which
                            have rich intersectionality with OCD & enhances understanding of the societal influences at
                            play. I argue that the former is a negative one, & that the latter is a positive one. In
                            other words, a new path forward for the betterment of society.

                        In this Super Mario Bros. X (A Super Mario fangame) episode, join Mario, Luigi, Toad & Toadette
                        as you partake
                        in this
                        traditional, yet benevolent epic. Essentially, it's an episode that takes great inspiration from
                        the NSMB series in terms of world layout and level progression, heavily incorporating elements
                        from many classic 2D Mario games you all know & love! It features the classic 8 world themes, as
                        well as a secret 9th world!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In terms of the story, it's about what you expect from many of the mainline Mario titles out
                        there, in which you rescue Princess Peach. However, Bowser has more of a... scientific... motive
                        for kidnapping Peach this time around. You'll meet various friends, learn more about the history
                        of the Mushroom Kingdom & embark on numerous challenges as you traverse Bowser's Darklands.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With over 100 unique levels, 90 stars to collect, 20 secret exits & a variety of boss fights
                        both nostalgic & innovative, it will certainly be an epic to remember!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have been a long-time player of SMBX for many years to date, and I've been working on this
                        episode on and off for as long as I can remember. This has been BY FAR my most pressing passion
                        project to date, spanning almost an entire decade! After rekindling my motivation for
                        Nintendo-level creating after 2-3 years of inactivity in between, I set out to finish what I've
                        started. I've been intensively working on completing this project ever since! Now, I am both
                        proud & ecstatic to finally release this project to both the SMBX community & my online
                        community!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I hope that you will all enjoy everything that this episode has to offer! I certainly enjoyed
                        pouring my heart & soul into every last object placed. I wouldn't change this journey for the
                        world, as it ignited a passion for creating & game design within me that I never would have
                        obtained otherwise.

                    <li>I have two naturally different coloured eyes! One eye is a slightly darker shade of brown
                        relative to another.
                    </li>
                    <li>I can often wake up early naturally without an alarm. (Ex. I can wake up between 7-8 AM after
                        going to bed at 1AM) Unfortunately, this also means I sometimes fall asleep in short bursts
                        throughout the day.
